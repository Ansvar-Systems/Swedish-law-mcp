## Overview

This MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides AI assistants with direct access to Swedish law through a comprehensive local database. Query statutes, court decisions, and legislative history with data integrity checks — every citation is verified against authoritative sources.

### 🎯 Verified Data Sources

Unlike general AI models that may generate plausible-sounding but fake legal citations, this MCP **only returns data from verified Swedish legal sources**. Every statute, case, and proposition in the database has been validated against official government databases (Riksdagen, lagen.nu). While we implement rigorous verification processes, users should always validate critical citations against primary sources.
