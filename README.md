## Overview

This MCP (Model Context Protocol) server gives AI assistants direct access to Swedish law from Riksdagen's official database. No more switching between tabs or searching through PDF documents.

### ⚠️ Critical Notices for Professional Use

**Before using this tool professionally, you MUST read:**

- **[DISCLAIMER.md](DISCLAIMER.md)** — Legal disclaimers, professional liability warnings, data authority limitations
- **[PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md)** — Client confidentiality concerns, Advokatsamfundet compliance, on-premise deployment options

**Key Warnings:**
- ❌ **Not legal advice** — research purposes only
- ❌ **Not production-ready** — pilot/research phase
- ❌ **Verify everything** — data may be incomplete, outdated, or incorrect
- ❌ **Client confidentiality** — queries flow through Claude API; use on-premise for privileged matters
- ❌ **Coverage gaps** — missing EU law, CJEU case law, historical versions

### What's Included

| **SFS** (Svensk Forfattningssamling) | Curated high-relevance statutes (family, civil, criminal, tax, procedure, public law) | Available |

### Use Cases

## Available Tools

### `search_legislation`

Full-text search across all Swedish statutes. Supports optional `as_of_date` (`YYYY-MM-DD`) for historical lookups.

```
"Search for data protection requirements in Swedish law"
-> Returns matching sections with context
```

### `get_provision`

Retrieve a specific section from a statute. Supports optional `as_of_date` (`YYYY-MM-DD`) to return the version valid on that date.

```
"Get SFS 2018:218 Chapter 3 Section 5"
-> Returns the full text of that section
```

### `search_case_law`

Search Swedish case law (rattsfall) by query, court, and date.

### `get_preparatory_works`

Get linked propositions/SOU documents for a statute (when available in seed data).

### `validate_citation`

Validate a citation against the local database and return warnings.

### `build_legal_stance`

Aggregate citations across legislation, case law, and preparatory works. Supports optional `as_of_date` for time-aware retrieval.

### `format_citation`

Format a citation in full, short, or pinpoint style.

### `check_currency`

Check if a statute is in force, amended, or repealed. Supports optional `as_of_date` for historical in-force status.

### Historical Coverage Note

- Historical queries are supported through provision validity windows.
- If a statute only has one consolidated provision version in seed data, `as_of_date` can still determine in-force status windows but may return current consolidated wording.
- Add explicit `provision_versions` in seed files to provide exact historical wording changes.
