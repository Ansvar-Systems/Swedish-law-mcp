# Swedish Law MCP Server

<!-- ANSVAR-CTA-BEGIN -->
> ### ▶ Try this MCP instantly via Ansvar Gateway
> **50 free queries/day · no card required · OAuth signup at [ansvar.eu/gateway](https://ansvar.eu/gateway)**
>
> One endpoint, one OAuth signup, access from any MCP-compatible client.

### Connect

**Claude Code** (one line):

```bash
claude mcp add ansvar --transport http https://gateway.ansvar.eu/mcp
```

**Claude Desktop / Cursor** — add to `claude_desktop_config.json` (or `mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ansvar": {
      "type": "url",
      "url": "https://gateway.ansvar.eu/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude.ai** — Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector → paste `https://gateway.ansvar.eu/mcp`

First request opens an OAuth flow at [ansvar.eu/gateway](https://ansvar.eu/gateway). After signup, your client is bound to your account; tier (free / premium / team / company) determines fan-out, quota, and which downstream MCPs are reachable.

---

## Self-host this MCP

You can also clone this repo and build the corpus yourself. The schema,
fetcher, and tool implementations all live here. What is not in the repo is
the pre-built database — TDM and standards-licensing constraints on the
upstream sources mean we host the corpus on Ansvar infrastructure rather
than redistribute it as a public artifact.

Build your own: run this repo's ingestion script (entry-point varies per
repo — typically `scripts/ingest.sh`, `npm run ingest`, or `make ingest`;
check the repo root).

Query **6,041 Swedish statutes** with **58,570 provisions** -- from Dataskyddslagen and Brottsbalken to Aktiebolagslagen, Miljöbalken, and more -- directly from Claude, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible client.

If you're building legal tech, compliance tools, or doing Swedish legal research, this is your verified reference database.

Built by [Ansvar Systems](https://ansvar.eu) -- Stockholm, Sweden

---

## Why This Exists

Swedish legal research is scattered across Riksdagen, SFS publications, lagen.nu, and EUR-Lex. Whether you're:
- A **lawyer** validating citations in a brief or contract
- A **compliance officer** checking if a statute is still in force
- A **legal tech developer** building tools on Swedish law
- A **researcher** tracing legislative history from proposition to statute

...you shouldn't need 47 browser tabs and manual PDF cross-referencing. Ask Claude. Get the exact provision. With context.

This MCP server makes Swedish law **searchable, cross-referenceable, and AI-readable**.

---

## Quick Start

### Use Locally (npm — recommended)

**Claude Desktop** — add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

**Cursor / VS Code:**

### Hosted via Ansvar Gateway (B2B, OAuth)

For organisations that want a single OAuth-gated endpoint covering this MCP plus the rest of the Ansvar fleet (multi-jurisdiction law, EU regulations, sector regulators, case law), use the [Ansvar Gateway](https://gateway.ansvar.eu) — a single MCP endpoint that routes and fans out across the full catalogue. Tier-gated (`premium`, `team`, `company`); requires an Ansvar account.

## Example Queries

Once connected, just ask naturally:

- *"What does Dataskyddslagen 3 kap. 5 § say about consent?"*
- *"Is PUL (1998:204) still in force?"*
- *"Find provisions about personuppgifter in Swedish law"*
- *"What EU directives does DSL implement?"*
- *"Which Swedish laws implement the GDPR?"*
- *"Get the preparatory works for Dataskyddslagen"*
- *"Compare incident reporting requirements across NIS2 Swedish implementations"*
- *"Validate the citation NJA 2020 s. 45"*
- *"Find Labour Court cases about discrimination from 2020-2023"*

## What's Included

| Category | Count | Details |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Statutes** | 6,041 statutes | Comprehensive Swedish legislation |
| **Provisions** | 58,570 sections | Full-text searchable with FTS5 |
| **Preparatory Works** | 6,735 documents | Propositions (Prop.) and SOUs |
| **EU Cross-References** | 668 references | 228 EU directives and regulations |
| **Legal Definitions** | 0 (free tier) | Table reserved, extraction not enabled in current free build |
| **Database Size** | ~125 MB | Optimized SQLite, portable |
| **Daily Updates** | Automated | Freshness checks against Riksdagen |

**Verified data only** -- every citation is validated against official sources (Riksdagen, lagen.nu, EUR-Lex). Zero LLM-generated content.

---

## See It In Action

### Why This Works

**Verbatim Source Text (No LLM Processing):**
- All statute text is ingested from Riksdagen/SFS official sources
- Provisions are returned **unchanged** from SQLite FTS5 database rows
- Zero LLM summarization or paraphrasing -- the database contains regulation text, not AI interpretations

**Smart Context Management:**
- Search returns ranked provisions with BM25 scoring (safe for context)
- Provision retrieval gives exact text by SFS number + chapter/section
- Cross-references help navigate without loading everything at once

**Technical Architecture:**
```
Riksdagen API → Parse → SQLite → FTS5 snippet() → MCP response
                  ↑                      ↑
           Provision parser       Verbatim database query
```

### Traditional Research vs. This MCP

| Traditional Approach | This MCP Server |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Search Riksdagen by SFS number | Search by plain Swedish: *"personuppgifter samtycke"* |
| Navigate multi-chapter statutes manually | Get the exact provision with context |
| Manual cross-referencing between laws | `build_legal_stance` aggregates across sources |
| "Is this statute still in force?" → check manually | `check_currency` tool → answer in seconds |
| Find EU basis → dig through EUR-Lex | `get_eu_basis` → linked EU directives instantly |
| Check 5+ sites for updates | Daily automated freshness checks |
| No API, no integration | MCP protocol → AI-native |

**Traditional:** Search Riksdagen → Download SFS PDF → Ctrl+F → Cross-reference with proposition → Check EUR-Lex for EU basis → Repeat

**This MCP:** *"What EU law is the basis for DSL 3 kap. 5 § about consent?"* → Done.

## Development

### Branching Strategy

This repository uses a `dev` integration branch. **Do not push directly to `main`.**

```
feature-branch → PR to dev → verify on dev → PR to main → deploy
```

- `main` is production-ready. Only receives merges from `dev` via PR.
- `dev` is the integration branch. All changes land here first.
- Feature branches are created from `dev`.

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ansvar-Systems/swedish-law-mcp
cd swedish-law-mcp
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

### Running Locally

```bash
npm run dev                                       # Start MCP server
npx @anthropic/mcp-inspector node dist/index.js   # Test with MCP Inspector
```

### Data Management

```bash
npm run ingest -- <sfs-number> <output.json>   # Ingest statute from Riksdagen
npm run ingest:auto-all -- --scope all-laws --dry-run  # Coverage audit against Riksdagen
npm run ingest:auto-all -- --scope all-laws   # Ingest full law-like corpus from Riksdagen
npm run ingest:cases:full-archive              # Ingest case law (full archive)
npm run sync:cases                             # Ingest case law (incremental)
npm run sync:prep-works                        # Sync preparatory works
npm run extract:definitions                    # Extract legal definitions
npm run build:db                               # Rebuild SQLite database
npm run check-updates                          # Check for amendments
```

### Performance

- **Search Speed:** <100ms for most FTS5 queries
- **Database Size:** ~125 MB (efficient, portable)
- **Reliability:** 100% ingestion success rate

## About Ansvar Systems

We build AI-accelerated compliance and legal research tools for the European market. This MCP server started as our internal reference tool for Swedish law -- turns out everyone building for the Swedish market has the same research frustrations.

So we're open-sourcing it. Navigating 6,041 statutes shouldn't require a law degree.
