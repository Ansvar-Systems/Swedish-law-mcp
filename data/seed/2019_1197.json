Bilaga (Översättning) Convention between the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden and the Government of the Kingdom of Greece for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and capital The Government of the Kingdom of Sweden and the Government of the Kingdom of Greece, Desiring to conclude a Convention for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and capital, Have agreed as follows: Article I This Convention applies to persons who are residents of one or both of the Contracting States. Article II (1) This Convention shall apply to taxes on income and capital imposed on behalf of each Contracting State or its political subdivisions or local authorities, irrespective of the manner in which they are levied. (2) There shall be regarded as taxes on income and capital all taxes imposed on total income, on total capital, or on the elements of income or of capital, including taxes on profits derived from the alienation of movable or immovable property and taxes on the total amounts of wages or salaries paid by enterprises. (3) The existing taxes to which this Convention shall apply are, in particular: (a) In the case of Greece: (i) the tax on individual incomes (including supplementary taxes); and (ii) the income tax on legal entities (hereinafter referred to as \"Greek tax\"). (b) In the case of Sweden: (i) the State income tax, including sailors tax and coupon tax; (ii) the tax on public entertainers; (iii) the communal income tax; and (iv) the State capital tax (hereinafter referred to as \"Swedish tax\"). (4) This Convention shall also apply to all identical or substantially similar taxes which are imposed in addition to, or in place of the existing taxes. At the end of each year, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall notify to each other any changes which have been made in their respective taxation laws. (5) The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement resolve any doubts which arise as to the taxes to which this Convention ought to apply. Article III (1) In the present Convention, unless the context otherwise requires - (a) The term \"competent authorities\" means, in the case of Sweden, the Minister of Finance or his authorised representative; in the case of Greece, the Minister of Finance or his authorized representative; (b) The term \"tax\" means Greek tax or Swedish tax, as the context requires; (c) The term \"person\" includes any body of persons, corporate or not corporate; (d) The term \"company\" means any body corporate; (e) (aa) The term \"resident\" of one of the Contracting States means any person who, under the law of that State, is liable to taxation therein by reason of his domicile, residence, place of management or any other similar criterion; but (bb) where by reason of the provisions of sub-paragraph (aa) above an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then this case shall be solved in accordance with the following rules: a) He shall be deemed to be a resident of the State in which he has a permanent home available to him. If he has a permanent home available to him in both Contracting States, he shall be deemed to be a resident of the State with which his personal and economic relations are closest (hereinafter referred to as his centre of vital interests); b) If the State in which he has his centre of vital interests cannot be determined, or if he has not a permanent home available to him in either State, he shall be deemed to be a resident of the State in which he has an habitual abode; c) If he has an habitual abode in both Contracting States or in neither of them, he shall be deemed to be a resident of the Contracting State of which he is a national; d) If he is a national of both Contracting States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the States shall determine the question by mutual agreement. (cc) Where by reason of the provisions of sub-paragraph (aa) above a legal person is a resident of both Contracting States, then it shall be deemed to be a resident of the State in which its place of effective management is situated. The same provision shall apply to partnerships and associations which are not legal persons under the national laws by which they are governed. (f) The terms \"resident of one of the Contracting States\" and \"resident of the other Contracting State\" mean a person who is a resident of Greece or a person who is a resident of Sweden, as the context requires; (g) The terms \"Greek enterprise\" and \"Swedish enterprise\" mean respectively an industrial or commercial enterprise or under- taking carried on by a resident of Greece and an industrial or commercial enterprise or undertaking carried on by a resident of Sweden, and the terms \"enterprise of one of the Contracting States\" and \"enterprise of the other Contracting State\" mean a Greek enterprise or a Swedish enterprise, as the context requires; (h) The term \"industrial or commercial profits\" includes rents or royalties in respect of cinematograph including television films; (i) (aa) The term \"permanent establishment\" means a fixed place of business in which the business of the enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. (bb) A permanent establishment shall include especially: a) a place of management; b) a branch; c) an office; d) a factory; e) a workshop; f) a mine, quarry or other place of extraction of natural resources; g) a building site or construction or assembly project which exists for more than twelve months. (cc) The term \"permanent establishment\" shall not be deemed to include: a) the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise; b) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery; c) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise; d) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise, or for collecting information, for the enterprise; e) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of advertising, for the supply of information, for scientific research or for similar activities which have a preparatory or auxiliary character, for the enterprise. (dd) A person acting in one of the Contracting States on behalf of an enterprise of the other Contracting State - other than an agent of an independent status to whom sub-paragraph (ee) applies - shall be deemed to be a permanent establishment in the first-mentioned State if he has, and habitually exercises in that State, an authority to conclude contracts in the name of the enterprise, unless his activities are limited to the purchase of goods or merchandise for the enterprise. (ee) An enterprise of one of the Contracting States shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in the other Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that other State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, where such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business. (ff) The fact that a company which is a resident of one of the Contracting States controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other. (j) The term \"international traffic\" includes traffic between places in one country in the course of a voyage which extends over more than one country. (2) In the application of the provisions of the present Con- vention by one of the Contracting States any term not otherwise defined shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning which it has under the laws in force in that State relating to the taxes which are the subject of the present Convention. Article IV (1) The profits of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, tax may be imposed in the other State on the profits of the enterprise but only on so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment. (2) Where an enterprise of one of the Contracting States carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing quite independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment. (3) In the determination of the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. (4) In so far as it has been customary in one of the Contracting States to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph (2) of this Article shall preclude such Contracting State from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary; the method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles laid down in this Article. (5) No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise. (6) For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary. Article V Where (a) an enterprise of one of the Contracting States participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or (b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States and an enterprise of the other Contracting State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. Article VI (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing Articles of this Convention, income derived from the operation in international traffic of ships registered in one of the Contracting States shall be exempt from tax in the other Contracting State, unless the enterprise is a resident of that other State; in such event the income may be taxed in the last-mentioned State. (2) Income from the operation of aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in the Contracting State in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated. Article VII (1) Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of Sweden to a resident of Greece shall be exempt from Swedish tax. (2) Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of Greece to a resident of Sweden shall in Greece be subject to Greek income tax provided that such dividends are deducted from the amount of the company's total net income subject to the income tax on legal entities. (3) Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of Greece to a company which is a resident of Sweden shall be exempt from Swedish tax. This exemption shall not apply unless in accordance with the laws of Sweden the dividends would have been exempt from Swedish tax if the first-mentioned company had been a resident of Sweden and not a resident of Greece. (4) Paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article shall not apply where a resident of one of the Contracting States has a permanent establishment in the other Contracting State and such dividends are directly associated with the business carried on through such permanent establishment; in such event Article IV of this Convention is applicable. Article VIII (1) Interest arising in one of the Contracting States and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State shall be taxable in that other State. (2) Nevertheless, a Contracting State in which interest arises which is paid to a resident of the other Contracting State shall retain the right under its own law to tax such interest. If it exercises such right, the rate of the tax which it charges may not exceed 10 per cent on the amount of the interest. The competent authorities of the two States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of such limitation. (3) The term \"interest\" employed in this Article means income from Government securities, bonds or debentures, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in profits, and debt-claims of every kind, as well as all other income assimilated by the taxation law to income from money lent. (4) The provisions of the foregoing paragraphs shall not apply if the recipient of the interest, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, has in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises a permanent establishment with which the debt-claim from which the interest arises is effectively connected. In such a case, Article IV of this Convention shall apply. (5) Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision of that State or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of one of the Contracting States or not, possesses in one of the Contracting States a permanent establishment for the require- ments of which the loan on which the interest is paid was effected, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated. (6) Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the recipient or between either of them and some other person, the amount of interest paid, having regard to the indebtedness in respect of which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the recipient in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such a case, the excess part of the interest shall be taxable in accordance with the laws of the two Contracting States due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention. Article IX (1) Royalties arising in one of the Contracting States and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State shall be taxable in that other State. (2) Nevertheless, a Contracting State in which royalties arise which are paid to a resident of the other Contracting State shall retain the right under its own law to tax such royalties. If it exercises such right, the rate of the tax which it charges may not exceed 5 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties. The competent authorities of the two States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of such limitation. (3) The term \"royalties\" employed in this Article means pay- ments of any kind received as consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work, any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret process or formula, or for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial or scientific equipment, or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience, but does not include any royalty or other amount paid in respect of the operation of a mine or quarry or of any other extraction of natural resources or in respect of cinematograph in-cluding television films. (4) Profits from the alienation of any property or rights mentioned in paragraph (3) shall be taxable only in the Contracting State of which the alienator is a resident. (5) The provisions of paragraphs (1), (2) and (4) shall not apply if the recipient of the royalties, being a resident of one of the Contracting States, has in the Contracting State in which the royalties arise a permanent establishment with which the right giving rise to the royalties is effectively connec- ted. In such a case, Article IV of this Convention shall apply. (6) Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the recipient or between either of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties paid, having regard to the use or right for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the recipient in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such a case, the excess part of the payments shall be taxable in accordance with the laws of the two Contracting States due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention. Article X (1) Income from immovable property may be taxed in the Contracting State in which such property is situated. (2) The term \"immovable property\" shall be defined in accordance with the laws of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment of agricultural and forestry enterprises, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting landed pro- perty apply, usufruct of immovable property and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for the working of mineral deposits, sources and other natural resources; ships, boats and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property. (3) The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) above shall apply to income derived from the direct use or from the letting of immovable property or the use in any other form of such property, including income from agricultural or forestry enterprises. They shall likewise apply to profits from the alienation of immovable property. (4) The provisions of paragraphs (1) to (3) above shall also apply to the income from immovable property of any enterprises other than agricultural or forestry enterprises and to income from immovable property used for the performance of professional services. Article XI A resident of one of the Contracting States shall be exempt in the other Contracting State from tax on gains from the sale, transfer, or exchange of capital assets other than immovable property, unless he has a permanent establishment in that other State and the gains are directly associated with the business carried on through such permanent establishment. Article XII Income derived by a resident of one of the Contracting States in respect of professional services or other independent activities of a similar character shall be taxable only in that Contracting State unless he has a fixed base regularly available to him in the other Contracting State for the purpose of performing his activities. If he has such a fixed base, such part of that income as is attributable to that base may be taxed in that other Contracting State. Article XIII (1) Subject to the provisions of Articles XIV, XV and XVI salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of one of the Contracting States in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in that State unless the employment is exercised in the other Contracting State. If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived therefrom may be taxed in that other State. (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) above, re- muneration derived by a resident of one of the Contracting States in respect of an employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State if: (a) the recipient is present in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in the taxable year concerned, and (b) the remuneration is paid by or on behalf of an employer who is not a resident of the other State, and (c) the remuneration is not deducted from the profits of a permanent establishment or a fixed base which the employer has in the other State. (3) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remuneration for personal services performed aboard: (a) a ship in international traffic and registered in one of the Contracting States may be taxed in that Contracting State unless the enterprise is a resident of the other State; in such event the income may be taxed in the last-mentioned State; and (b) an aircraft in international traffic may be taxed in the Contracting State in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated. Article XIV (1) Remuneration, including pensions, paid by or out of funds created by one of the Contracting States or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof to any individual in respect of services rendered to that State or subdivision or local authority thereof in the discharge of functions of a governmental nature may be taxed in that State. The same shall apply as regards other pensions paid by the State as well as pensions paid by social insurance institutions and similar organisations. (2) The provisions of Articles XIII, XV and XVI shall apply to remuneration and pensions in respect of services rendered in connection with any trade or business carried on by one of the Contracting States or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof. Article XV Directors' fees and similar payments derived by a resident of one of the Contracting States in his capacity as a member of the board of directors of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. Article XVI Subject to the provisions of paragraph (1) of Article XIV pen- sions and other similar payments paid in consideration of past employment shall be taxable only in the Contracting State of which the recipient is a resident. Article XVII Notwithstanding anything contained in this Convention, income derived by public entertainers, such as theatre, motion picture, radio or television artists, and musicians, and by athletes, from their personal activities as such may be taxed in the Contracting State in which these activities are exercised. Article XVIII (1) Any annuity, derived from sources within Sweden by an individual who is a resident of Greece, shall be exempt from Swedish tax. (2) Any annuity, derived from sources within Greece by an individual who is a resident of Sweden, shall be exempt from Greek tax. (3) The term \"annuity\" means a stated sum payable, under an obligation, periodically at stated times during life or during a specified or ascertainable period of time. Article XIX A professor or teacher of an establishment for higher education or scientific research in one of the Contracting States, who receives remuneration for teaching or for carrying out advanced study or research, during a period of temporary residence not exceeding two years, at a university, college or other establishment for higher education or for research in the other Contracting State, shall be exempt from tax in that other State in respect of that remuneration, provided that such establishment belongs to the State or to non profit- making legal entities under the Public or Private law. Article XX (1) Payments which a student or business apprentice from one of the Contracting States who is present in the other Contracting State solely for the purpose of his education or training receives for the purpose of his maintenance, education or training, shall not be taxed in that other State, provided that such payments are made to him from sources outside that other State. (2) An individual from one of the Contracting States who is present in the other Contracting State solely as a student at a university, college or school in the other State or as a business apprentice, shall not be taxed in that other State for a period not exceeding three consecutive taxable years in respect of remuneration from employment in such other State, provided that (a) the remuneration constitutes earnings necessary for his maintenance and education, and (b) the said remuneration does not exceed in the taxable year 4.000 Swedish crowns or the equivalent thereof in the currency of Greece as the case may be. Article XXI The items of income not expressly mentioned in the foregoing Articles of the Convention shall be taxable only in the Contracting State of which the recipient is a resident. Article XXII Where taxes on capital are imposed by one or other or both of the Contracting States the following provisions shall apply: (a) Capital represented by immovable property, as defined in paragraph (2) of Article X, may be taxed in the Contracting State in which such property is situated. (b) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (a) above, capital represented by assets forming part of the business property employed in a permanent establishment of an enterprise, or by assets pertaining to a fixed base used for the performance of professional services, may be taxed in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. (c) All other elements of capital of a resident of one of the Contracting States shall be taxable only in that State. Article XXIII (1) Subject to the provisions of the law of Greece regarding the allowance as a credit against Greek tax of tax payable in a territory outside Greece, Swedish tax payable under the laws of Sweden and in accordance with this Convention, whether directly or by deduction, in respect of income from sources within Sweden shall be allowed as a credit against any Greek tax payable in respect of that income. (2) Income from sources within Greece which in accordance with this Convention may be taxed in Greece either directly or by deduction, shall be exempt from Swedish tax, provided that a) where such income is (i) a dividend paid by a company being a resident of Greece to a person resident of Sweden, not being a company which is exempt from Swedish tax according to the provisions of paragraph (3) of Article VII, or (ii) any interest to which paragraph (2) of Article VIII applies and which is paid to a resident of Sweden, or (iii) any royalty to which paragraph (2) of Article IX applies and which is paid to a resident of Sweden, Swedish tax shall be charged on the gross amount of such income, but the amount of Greek income tax appropriate to that income shall be allowed as a credit against any Swedish tax payable in respect of that income; b) when the Greek income tax appropriate to the dividend, the interest or the royalty, as the case may be, has been wholly relieved or reduced for a limited period of time, the credit against Swedish tax in respect of such income shall be allowed in an amount equal to the Greek income tax which would have been appropriate to the dividend, the interest or the royalty if no such relief had been given or no such reduction had been allowed; c) where interest arising in Greece is paid to a resident of Sweden during the period of the first ten taxable years of the application of the Convention, the credit against Swedish tax payable in respect of that interest shall, notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraphs a) and b), be allowed in an amount equal to ten per cent of the amount of such interest. (3) If, in accordance with Article XXII, capital belonging to a person resident of Sweden may be taxed in Greece, such capital shall be exempt from Swedish tax. (4) The graduated rate of Swedish tax to be imposed on residents of Sweden may be calculated as though income or capital exempted under this Convention were included in the amount of the total income or capital. Article XXIV (1) Where under the provisions of this Convention a resident of Greece is exempt or entitled to relief from Swedish tax, similar exemption or relief shall be applied to the undivided estate of a deceased person in so far as one or more of the beneficiaries is a resident of Greece. (2) Swedish tax on the undivided estate of a deceased person shall, in so far as the income accrues to a beneficiary who is resident in Greece, be allowed as a credit under Article XXIII. Article XXV (1) The nationals of one of the Contracting States shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances are or may be subjected. (2) The term \"nationals\" means - (a) in relation to Greece, all Greek citizens and all legal persons, partnerships and associations deriving their status as such from the law in force in Greece, (b) in relation to Sweden, all Swedish subjects and all legal persons, partnerships and associations deriving their status as such from the law in force in Sweden. (3) The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of one of the Contracting States has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities. This provision shall not be construed as obliging one of the Contracting States to grant to residents of the other Contracting State any personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family responsibilities which it grants to its own residents. (4) Enterprises of one of the Contracting States, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of that first- mentioned State are or may be subjected. (5) In this Article the term \"taxation\" means taxes of every kind and description. Article XXVI The provisions of the present Convention shall not affect the right to more extensive exemptions which are granted to diplomatic or consular officials by virtue of the general rules of international law or by special agreements. In so far as, under this system of more extensive exemption, income and capital are not subject to tax in the receiving State, the right to taxation shall be reserved to the State which such officials represent. Article XXVII The competent authorities of the Contracting States may exchange such information (being information which is at their disposal under their respective taxation laws in the normal course of administration) as is necessary for carrying out the provisions of the present Convention or for the prevention of fraud or for the administration of statutory provisions against legal avoidance in relation to the taxes which are the subject of the present Convention. Any information so exchanged shall be treated as secret and shall not be disclosed to any persons other than those, including a court, concerned with the assessment and collection of the taxes or the determination of appeals in relation thereto. No informa- tion as aforesaid shall be exchanged which would disclose any trade, business, industrial or professional secret or trade process. Information as aforesaid may be exchanged ex officio or, in particular cases, on demand. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall consult together to determine the information to be exchanged ex officio. Article XXVIII (1) Where a taxpayer shows proof that the action of the tax authorities of either Contracting State has resulted, or will result, in taxation contrary to the provisions of the present Convention, he shall be entitled to present the facts to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which he is a resident. Such a claim shall be filed before an appeal against the taxation in dispute is lodged with a Greek tax court. Should the claim be upheld, the competent authority to which the facts are so presented shall undertake to come to an agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State with a view to avoidance of the taxation in question. (2) Should any difficulty or doubt arise as to the interpretation or application of the present Convention, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement. Article XXIX The following agreements between Greece and Sweden shall not have effect for any period for which the present Convention has effect, that is to say, (a) the agreement dated 19th November, 1931, for the reciprocal exemption from income tax in certain cases of profits accruing from the business of shipping; (b) the agreement dated 27th May, 1954, for the reciprocal ex- emption from taxes of profits accruing from the business of air transport. Article XXX (1) The present Convention shall be ratified by the Contracting States in accordance with their respective constitutional and legal requirements. (2) The instruments of ratification shall be exchanged at Stockholm as soon as possible. (3) Upon exchange of ratifications the present Convention shall have effect in respect of income derived on or after 1st January in the calendar year in which the exchange of ratifications takes place; and, as regards the Swedish State capital tax, in respect of tax which is assessed in or after the calendar year next following that in which the exchange of ratifications takes place. Article XXXI The present Convention shall continue in effect indefinitely but either of the Contracting Governments may, on or before 30th June in any calendar year not earlier than the year 1965, give to the other Contracting Government, through diplomatic channels, written notice of termination and, in such event, the present Convention shall cease to be effective in respect of income derived on or after 1st January in the calendar year next following that in which such notice is given; and as regards capital tax, in respect of tax assessed in or after the second calendar year following that in which such notice is given. In witness whereof the undersigned being duly authorized thereto have signed the present Convention and have affixed thereto their seals.

De för närvarande utgående skatter, å vilka avtalet skall äga tilllämpning, äro särskilt: 1) Beträffande Grekland: a) Skatten å fysiska personers inkomst, tilläggsskatter däri inbegripna, samt b) inkomstskatten å juridiska personer; skatt av sådant slag benämnes i det följande \"grekisk skatt\". 2) Beträffande Sverige: a) Den statliga inkomstskatten, sjömansskatten och kupongskatten däri inbegripna; b) bevillningsavgifterna för särskilda förmåner och rättigheter; c) den kommunala inkomstskatten, samt d) den statliga förmögenhetsskatten; skatt av sådant slag benämnes i det följande \"svensk skatt\". § 4. Avtalet skall likaledes tilllämpas å skatter av samma eller i huvudsak likartat slag, vilka framdeles uttagas vid sidan av eller i stället för de för närvarande utgående skatterna. De behöriga myndigheterna i de båda avtalsslutande staterna skola vid utgången av varje år meddela varandra ändringar i skattelagstiftningen. § 5. De behöriga myndigheterna i de båda avtalsslutande staterna skola i samförstånd avgöra uppkommande tvivelsmål rörande vilka skatter som inbegripas under avtalet. Artikel III § 1. Där icke sammanhanget annat föranleder, skola i detta avtal följande uttryck hava nedan angiven betydelse: a) Uttrycket \"behöriga myndigheter\" åsyftar för Sveriges vidkommande finansministern eller hans befullmäktigade ombud och för Greklands vidkommande finansministern eller hans befullmäktigade ombud. b) Uttrycket \"skatt\" åsyftar grekisk skatt eller svensk skatt, alltefter som sammanhanget kräver. c) Uttrycket \"person\" inbegriper varje sammanslutning av personer, antingen denna utgör en juridisk person eller icke. d) Uttrycket \"bolag\" åsyftar varje slag av juridisk person. e) I) Uttrycket \"person med hemvist\" i en av de avtalsslutande staterna åsyftar varje person, som enligt den statens lagstiftning är underkastad beskattning därstädes på grund av hemvist, bosättning, plats för företagsledning eller varje annan liknande omständighet. II) Då på grund av bestämmelserna i punkt I) ovan en fysisk person äger hemvist i båda avtalsslutande staterna, skall följande gälla: 1) Han skall anses äga hemvist i den stat, i vilken han har ett hem som stadigvarande står till hans förfogande. Om han har ett sådant hem i båda avtalsslutande staterna, anses han äga hemvist i den stat, med vilken han har de starkaste personliga och ekonomiska förbindelserna (här nedan betecknat såsom centrum för levnadsintressena). 2) Om det icke kan avgöras, i vilken stat centrum för levnads- intressena befinner sig, eller om han icke i någondera staten har ett hem, som stadigvarande står till hans förfogande, anses han äga hemvist i den stat, där han stadigvarande vistas. 3) Om han stadigvarande vistas i båda avtalsslutande staterna eller om han icke vistas stadigvarande i någon av dem, anses han äga hemvist i den avtalsslutande stat, i vilken han är medborgare. 4) Om han är medborgare i båda avtalsslutande staterna eller om han icke är medborgare i någon av dem, skola de behöriga myndigheterna i de båda staterna avgöra frågan genom överenskommelse. III) Då på grund av bestämmelserna i punkt I) ovan en juridisk person äger hemvist i båda avtalsslutande staterna, anses dess hemvist förefinnas i den stat, där dess verkliga ledning är belägen. Detsamma gäller sådana bolag och andra sammanslutningar, vilka enligt vederbörande stats lagstiftning icke äro juridiska personer. f) Uttrycken \"person med hemvist i en av de avtalsslutande staterna\" och \"person med hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten\" åsyfta en person med hemvist i Grekland eller en person med hemvist i Sverige, alltefter som sammanhanget kräver. g) Uttrycken \"grekiskt företag\" och \"svenskt företag\" åsyfta ett rörelseidkande företag, som bedrives av en person med hemvist i Grekland respektive ett rörelseidkande företag, som bedrives av en person med hemvist i Sverige; uttrycken \"företag i en av de avtalsslutande staterna\" och \"företag i den andra avtalsslutande staten\" åsyfta ett grekiskt företag eller ett svenskt företag, alltefter som sammanhanget kräver. h) Uttrycket \"inkomst av rörelse\" inbegriper hyresavgifter eller royalty för kinematografisk film ävensom televisionsfilm. i) I) Med uttrycket \"fast driftställe\" förstås en stadigvarande affärsanordning, i vilken företagets verksamhet helt eller delvis utövas. II) Såsom fast driftställe anses särskilt: 1) plats för företagsledning, 2) filial, 3) kontor, 4) fabrik, 5) verkstad, 6) gruva, stenbrott eller annan plats för utnyttjandet av naturtillgångar, 7) plats för byggnads-, anläggnings- eller installationsarbete, som varar mer än tolv månader. III) Uttrycket \"fast driftställe\" skall icke anses innefatta: 1) användningen av anordningar, avsedda uteslutande för lagring, utställning eller utlämnande av företaget tillhöriga varor, 2) innehavet av ett företaget tillhörigt varulager, avsett uteslutande för lagring, utställning eller utlämnande, 3) innehavet av ett företaget tillhörigt varulager, avsett uteslutande för bearbetning eller förädling genom ett annat företags försorg, 4) innehavet av en stadigvarande affärsanordning, avsedd uteslutande för inköp av varor eller införskaffande av upplysningar för företagets räkning, 5) innehavet av en stadigvarande affärsanordning, avsedd uteslutande för att för företagets räkning ombesörja reklam, meddela upplysningar, bedriva vetenskaplig forskning eller utöva liknande verksamhet, under förutsättning att verksamheten är av förberedande eller biträdande art. IV) En person, som är verksam i en av de avtalsslutande staterna för ett företag i den andra avtalsslutande staten - härunder inbegripes icke sådan oberoende representant som avses i punkt V) - behandlas såsom ett fast driftställe i den förstnämnda staten om han innehar och i den förstnämnda staten regelbundet använder en fullmakt att sluta avtal i företagets namn samt verksamheten icke begränsas till inköp av varor för företagets räkning. V) Ett företag i en av de avtalsslutande staterna anses icke hava ett fast driftställe i den andra avtalsslutande staten allenast på den grund, att företaget uppehåller affärsförbindelser i den andra staten genom förmedling av en mäklare, kommissionär eller annan fullständigt oberoende representant, under förutsättning att dessa personer därvid fullgöra uppdrag, vilka tillhöra deras vanliga affärs- verksamhet. VI) Den omständigheten, att ett bolag med hemvist i en av de avtalsslutande staterna kontrollerar eller kontrolleras av ett bolag, som har sitt hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten eller som uppehåller affärsförbindelser i denna andra stat (antingen genom ett fast driftställe eller annorledes), skall icke i och för sig medföra att någotdera bolaget betraktas såsom ett fast driftställe för det andra bolaget. j) Uttrycket \"internationell trafik\" inbegriper trafik som utövas mellan orter i ett och samma land såsom ett led i trafik mellan två eller flera länder. § 2. Då en av de avtalsslutande staterna tillämpar bestämmelserna i detta avtal, skall, såvitt icke sammanhanget annorlunda kräver, varje däri förekommande uttryck, vars innebörd icke särskilt angivits, anses hava den betydelse, som uttrycket har enligt gällande lagar inom den ifrågavarande staten rörande sådana skatter, som äro föremål för avtalet. Artikel IV § 1. Inkomst av rörelse, åtnjuten av ett företag i en av de avtalsslutande staterna, må beskattas allenast i denna stat, såvida icke företaget bedriver rörelse i den andra avtalsslutande staten från ett där beläget fast driftställe. Om företaget bedriver rörelse på nyss angivet sätt, äger den andra avtalsslutande staten beskatta företagets inkomst men endast så stor del därav, som är hänförlig till det fasta driftstället. § 2. Om ett företag i en av de avtalsslutande staterna bedriver rörelse i den andra avtalsslutande staten från ett där beläget fast driftställe, skall i vardera staten till det fasta driftstället hänföras den inkomst av rörelse, som driftstället kan antagas skola hava åtnjutit, därest driftstället varit ett fristående företag med samma eller liknande verksamhet, bedriven under samma eller liknande villkor, samt driftstället självständigt avslutat affärer med det företag, till vilket driftstället hör. § 3. Vid bestämmandet av det fasta driftställets inkomst av rörelse skall avdrag medgivas för alla kostnader som uppkommit för det fasta driftställets räkning, härunder inbegripna kostnader för företagets ledning och allmänna förvaltning, oavsett om kostnaderna uppkommit i den avtalsslutande stat där det fasta driftstället är beläget eller annorstädes. § 4. Vad i § 2 av denna artikel stadgas skall emellertid - i den mån i en av de avtalsslutande staterna inkomst hänförlig till ett fast driftställe brukat bestämmas på grundval av en fördelning av företagets hela inkomst på de olika delarna av företaget - icke hindra att i denna avtalsslutande stat den skattepliktiga inkomsten bestämmes genom ett dylikt brukligt förfarande. Förfarandet skall dock vara sådant att resultatet står i överensstämmelse med de i denna artikel angivna prin- ciperna. § 5. Inkomst skall icke anses hänförlig till ett fast driftställe allenast av den anledningen att det fasta driftstället inköper varor för företagets räkning. § 6. Vid tillämpningen av föregående paragrafer skall inkomst hänförlig till det fasta driftstället bestämmas genom samma förfarande år från år såvida icke särskilda förhållanden annat föranleda. Artikel V I fall då a) ett företag i en av de avtalsslutande staterna direkt eller indirekt deltager i ledningen eller övervakningen av ett företag i den andra avtalsslutande staten eller äger del i detta företags kapital, eller b) samma personer direkt eller indirekt deltaga i ledningen eller övervakningen av såväl ett företag i en av de avtalsslutande staterna som ett företag i den andra avtals- slutande staten eller äga del i båda dessa företags kapital, skall iakttagas följande. Om mellan företagen i fråga om handel eller andra ekonomiska förbindelser avtalas eller föreskrivas villkor, som avvika från dem som skulle hava avtalats mellan två av varandra oberoende företag, må alla vinster, som skulle hava tillkommit det ena företaget om sagda villkor icke funnits men som på grund av villkoren i fråga icke tillkommit detta företag, inräknas i detta företags inkomster och beskattas i överensstämmelse därmed. Artikel VI § 1. Utan hinder av bestämmelserna i föregående artiklar av detta avtal skall inkomst, som förvärvas genom utövande av sjöfart i internationell trafik medelst fartyg registrerade i en av de avtalsslutande staterna, vara undantagen från beskattning i den andra avtalsslutande staten, såvida icke företaget äger hemvist i denna andra stat; i dylikt fall må den sistnämnda staten beskatta inkomsten. § 2. Inkomst, som förvärvas genom utövande av luftfart i internationell trafik, skall beskattas allenast i den avtalsslutande stat, i vilken företaget har sin verkliga ledning. Artikel VII § 1. Utdelning från ett bolag med hemvist i Sverige till en person med hemvist i Grekland skall vara undantagen från svensk skatt. § 2. Utdelning från ett bolag med hemvist i Grekland till en person med hemvist i Sverige skall i Grekland vara underkastad grekisk inkomstskatt under förutsättning att utdelningen avdrages från det belopp av bolagets sammanlagda nettoinkomst, som är föremål för den grekiska inkomstskatten å juridiska personer. § 3. Utdelning från ett bolag med hemvist i Grekland till ett bolag med hemvist i Sverige skall vara undantagen från svensk skatt. Denna skattebefrielse inträder dock icke med mindre förhållandena äro sådana att utdelningen enligt svensk lag skulle ha varit undantagen från svensk skatt, om det förstnämnda bolaget hade varit att anse som bosatt i Sverige och icke i Grekland. § 4. Bestämmelserna i §§ 1 och 2 av denna artikel äro icke tilllämpliga, om en person med hemvist i en av de avtalsslutande staterna innehar ett fast driftställe i den andra avtalsslutande staten och utdelningen i fråga äger direkt samband med den från driftstället bedrivna rörelsen; i dylikt fall skall artikel IV av detta avtal äga tillämpning. Artikel VIII § 1. Ränta, som härrör från en av de avtalsslutande staterna och utbetalas till en person med hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten, må beskattas i denna andra stat. § 2. Den avtalsslutande stat, från vilken härrör ränta som utbetalas till en person med hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten, skall dock vara bibehållen vid rätten att enligt sin egen lagstiftning beskatta räntan. Utövas denna beskattningsrätt, får den påförda skatten icke överstiga 10 procent av räntans belopp. De behöriga myndigheterna i de båda staterna skola träffa överenskommelse om tillämpningen av nämnda begränsning. § 3. Med uttrycket \"ränta\" förstås i denna artikel inkomst av värdepapper som utfärdats av staten, av obligationer eller debentures, antingen desamma utfärdats mot säkerhet i egendom eller icke och antingen de representera en rätt till andel i vinst eller icke, samt av varje annat slags fordran ävensom all annan inkomst, vilken enligt skattelagstiftningen jämställes med inkomst av försträckning. § 4. Bestämmelserna i föregående paragrafer äro icke tillämp- liga, om den person, som äger hemvist i en av de avtalsslutande staterna och uppbär räntan, innehar ett fast driftställe i den andra avtalsslutande staten varifrån räntan härrör och den fordran av vilken räntan härflyter äger verkligt samband med det fasta driftstället. I dylikt fall skall artikel IV av detta avtal äga tillämpning. § 5. Ränta skall anses härröra från en avtalsslutande stat, om utbetalaren är staten själv, en politisk underavdelning till staten eller en person med hemvist i denna stat. Om den person som utbetalar räntan - antingen han äger hemvist i en av de avtalsslutande staterna eller ej - i en av de avtalsslutande staterna innehar ett fast driftställe, för vilket upptagits det lån som räntan avser, och räntan bestrides av det fasta driftstället, skall räntan dock anses härröra från den avtalsslutande stat, i vilken det fasta driftstället är beläget. § 6. Beträffande sådana fall, då särskilda förbindelser mellan utbetalaren och mottagaren eller mellan dem båda och annan person föranleda att det utbetalade räntebeloppet med hänsyn till den skuld, för vilken räntan erlägges, överstiger det belopp som skulle hava avtalats mellan utbetalaren och mottagaren om dylika förbindelser icke förelegat, skola be- stämmelserna i denna artikel gälla allenast för sistnämnda belopp. I dylikt fall skall överskjutande räntebelopp beskattas i enlighet med lagstiftningen i de båda avtals- slutande staterna med iakttagande av övriga bestämmelser i detta avtal. Artikel IX § 1. Royalty, som härrör från en av de avtalsslutande staterna och utbetalas till en person med hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten, må beskattas i denna andra stat. § 2. Den avtalsslutande stat, från vilken härrör royalty som utbetalas till en person med hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten, skall dock vara bibehållen vid rätten att enligt sin egen lagstiftning beskatta royaltyn. Utövas denna beskattningsrätt, får den påförda skatten icke överstiga 5 procent av royaltyns bruttobelopp. De behöriga myndigheterna i de båda staterna skola träffa överenskommelse om tillämp- ningen av nämnda begränsning. § 3. Med uttrycket \"royalty\" förstås i denna artikel varje slag av utbetalning, som uppbäres såsom ersättning för upphovsrätt till litterära, konstnärliga eller vetenskapliga verk, för nyttjandet av eller rätten att nyttja patent, varu- märke, mönster eller modell, ritning, hemlig fabrikationsmetod eller recept, för nyttjandet av eller rätten att nyttja industriell, kommersiell eller vetenskaplig utrustning eller för upplysningar om erfarenhetsrön av industriell, kommersiell eller vetenskaplig natur; uttrycket omfattar däremot icke något slag av royalty eller annat belopp, som utbetalas för nyttjandet av gruva, stenbrott eller annan naturtillgång eller för kinematografisk film eller televisionsfilm. § 4. Inkomst genom avyttring av egendom eller rättighet, som avses i § 3, skall beskattas allenast i den avtalsslutande stat i vilken säljaren äger hemvist. § 5. Bestämmelserna i §§ 1, 2 och 4 äro icke tillämpliga, om den person, som äger hemvist i en av de avtalsslutande staterna och som uppbär royaltyn, innehar ett fast driftställe i den andra avtalsslutande staten varifrån royaltyn härrör och den rättighet av vilken royaltyn härflyter äger verkligt samband med det fasta driftstället. I dylikt fall skall artikel IV av detta avtal äga tillämpning. § 6. Beträffande sådana fall, då särskilda förbindelser mellan utbetalaren och mottagaren eller mellan dem båda och annan person föranleda att det utbetalade royaltybeloppet med hänsyn till det nyttjande eller den rätt, för vilken royaltyn erlägges, överstiger det belopp, som skulle hava avtalats mellan utbetalaren och mottagaren om dylika förbindelser icke förelegat, skola bestämmelserna i denna artikel gälla allenast för sistnämnda belopp. I dylikt fall skall överskjutande ersättningsbelopp beskattas i enlighet med lagstiftningen i de båda avtalsslutande staterna med iakttagande av övriga bestämmelser i detta avtal. Artikel X § 1. Inkomst av fastighet må beskattas i den avtalsslutande stat i vilken fastigheten är belägen. § 2. Uttrycket \"fastighet\" skall hava den betydelse som uttrycket har enligt gällande lagar i den avtalsslutande stat, i vilken egendomen i fråga är belägen. Under detta uttryck in- begripes dock städse egendom som utgör tillbehör till fastighet, levande och döda inventarier i lantbruk och skogs- bruk, rättigheter å vilka föreskrifterna i allmän lag angående fastigheter äga tillämpning, nyttjanderätt till fastighet och rätt till föränderliga eller fasta ersättningar för nyttjandet av gruvor och andra naturtillgångar. Fartyg och luftfartyg skola däremot icke betraktas såsom fastigheter. § 3. Bestämmelserna i §§ 1 och 2 ovan skola äga tillämpning såväl å inkomst, vilken förvärvas genom omedelbart brukande av fastighet, som å inkomst, vilken erhålles genom uthyrning av fastighet eller genom annan användning av fastigheten, därunder inbegripet inkomst av lantbruks- och skogsföretag. Bestämmelserna skola likaledes tillämpas å inkomst genom avyttring av fastighet. § 4. Bestämmelserna i §§ 1-3 ovan skola även äga tillämpning å sådan inkomst av fastighet som förvärvas av annat företag än lantbruks- eller skogsföretag ävensom inkomst av fastighet som användes vid utövandet av fria yrken. Artikel XI En person med hemvist i en av de avtalsslutande staterna skall vara befriad från skatt i den andra avtalsslutande staten å vinst på grund av försäljning, överlåtelse eller byte av förmögenhetstillgångar som ej utgöras av fastighet, såvida icke personen i fråga innehar ett fast driftställe i denna andra stat och vinsten äger direkt samband med den från driftstället bedrivna rörelsen. Artikel XII Inkomst, som förvärvas av en person med hemvist i en av de avtalsslutande staterna genom utövande av fritt yrke eller annan därmed jämförbar självständig verksamhet, skall beskattas allenast i denna stat om han icke har en stadigvarande anordning i den andra avtalsslutande staten, som regelmässigt står till hans förfogande för utövandet av verk- samheten. Därest han har en sådan stadigvarande anordning, må den del av inkomsten som är hänförlig till denna anordning beskattas i den andra avtalsslutande staten. Artikel XIII § 1. Där icke artiklarna XIV, XV och XVI annat föranleda skola löner och liknande ersättningar, som en person med hemvist i en av de avtalsslutande staterna uppbär på grund av arbetsanställning, beskattas allenast i denna stat, såvida icke arbetet utföres i den andra avtalsslutande staten. Om arbetet utföres i den andra staten, må ersättningen på grund av anställningen beskattas i denna stat. § 2. Utan hinder av bestämmelserna i § 1 ovan skall ersättning, som en person med hemvist i en av de avtalsslutande staterna uppbär på grund av arbete som utföres i den andra avtalsslutande staten, beskattas allenast i den förstnämnda staten, under förutsättning att a) inkomsttagaren vistas i denna andra stat under en tidrymd eller tidrymder, som sammanlagt icke överstiga 183 dagar under beskattningsåret i fråga, b) ersättningen betalas av eller på uppdrag av en arbetsgivare, som ej äger hemvist i denna andra stat, och c) ersättningen ej såsom omkostnad belastar ett fast driftställe eller en stadigvarande anordning, som arbetsgivaren har i denna andra stat. § 3. Utan hinder av vad som stadgas ovan i denna artikel må ersättning för personligt arbete, som fullgöres a) ombord å fartyg i internationell trafik, vilket är registrerat i en av de avtalsslutande staterna, beskattas i denna avtalsslutande stat, såvida icke företaget äger hemvist i den andra staten; i dylikt fall må inkomsten beskattas i den sistnämnda staten; samt b) ombord å luftfartyg i internationell trafik, beskattas i den avtalsslutande stat, i vilken företaget har sin verkliga ledning. Artikel XIV § 1. Ersättningar, pensioner däri inbegripna, vilka utbetalas av - eller från fonder inrättade av - en av de avtalsslutande staterna, dess politiska underavdelningar eller lokala myndigheter till en fysisk person såsom ersättning för arbete, som utförts i tjänst hos samma stat, underavdelning eller lokala myndighet, må beskattas i den staten. Motsvarande skall gälla i fråga om andra pensioner, som utbetalas av staten, ävensom pensioner som utbetalas av socialförsäkringsanstalter och liknande inrättningar. § 2. Bestämmelserna i artiklarna XIII, XV och XVI äro tillämp- liga å ersättningar och pensioner som utbetalas för tjänster, utförda i samband med rörelse som bedrivits av en av de avtalsslutande staterna, dess politiska underavdelningar eller lokala myndigheter. Artikel XV Styrelsearvoden eller liknande ersättningar, som uppbäras av en person med hemvist i en av de avtalsslutande staterna i egenskap av styrelseledamot i ett bolag med hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten, må beskattas i denna andra stat. Artikel XVI Där icke bestämmelserna i § 1 av artikel XIV annat föranleda, skola pensioner och liknande ersättningar, som utbetalas i anledning av tidigare anställning, beskattas allenast i den avtalsslutande stat i vilken den som uppbär ersättningen äger hemvist. Artikel XVII Utan hinder av vad eljest i detta avtal stadgas må inkomst, som skådespelare, filmskådespelare, radio- eller televisionsartister, musiker och dylika ävensom idrottsmän förvärva under sin yrkesutövning, beskattas i den avtals- slutande stat, i vilken yrket utövas. Artikel XVIII § 1. Livräntor, uppburna från inkomstkällor i Sverige av en fysisk person med hemvist i Grekland, skola vara undantagna från svensk skatt. § 2. Livräntor, uppburna från inkomstkällor i Grekland av en fysisk person med hemvist i Sverige, skola vara undantagna från grekisk skatt. § 3. Med \"livränta\" förstås ett fastställt belopp, som på grund av förpliktelse skall utbetalas periodiskt på fastställda tider under vederbörandes livstid eller under annan angiven eller fastställbar tidsperiod. Artikel XIX En professor eller lärare vid en institution för högre utbildning eller vetenskaplig forskning i en av de avtalsslutande staterna, som uppbär ersättning för undervisning eller för vetenskapliga studier eller forskning vid universitet, högskola eller annan institution för högre utbildning eller för forskning i den andra avtalsslutande staten under tillfällig vistelse därstädes, ej överstigande två år, skall vara befriad från beskattning i sistnämnda stat för ersättningen därest ifrågavarande institution tillhör staten eller ock privaträttslig eller offentligrättslig juridisk person, vars verksamhet icke bedrives i vinstsyfte. Artikel XX § 1. En studerande eller affärs- eller hantverkspraktikant från en av de avtalsslutande staterna, som vistas i den andra avtalsslutande staten allenast för sin undervisning eller utbildning, skall ej beskattas i denna andra stat för belopp, som han uppbär till bestridande av sitt uppehälle, sin undervisning eller sin utbildning, därest beloppen i fråga utbetalas till honom från utlandet. § 2. En fysisk person från en av de avtalsslutande staterna, som vistas i den andra avtalsslutande staten allenast såsom studerande vid universitet, högskola eller skola i den staten eller såsom affärs- eller hantverkspraktikant, skall under en period icke överstigande tre på varandra följande beskattningsår vara befriad från beskattning i denna andra stat för inkomst av anställning därstädes, under förutsättning att a) inkomsten är erforderlig för att bestrida kostnaderna för hans uppehälle och undervisning, och b) inkomsten i fråga icke överstiger 4 000 svenska kronor under beskattningsåret respektive motsvarande belopp i grekisk valuta. Artikel XXI Inkomst, beträffande vilken ingen uttrycklig bestämmelse meddelats i föregående artiklar av avtalet, skall beskattas allenast i den avtalsslutande stat i vilken den som uppbär inkomsten äger hemvist. Artikel XXII Om skatt å förmögenhet utgår i en av de avtalsslutande staterna eller i båda staterna, skola följande bestämmelser äga tillämpning: a) Förmögenhet bestående av sådan fastighet som avses i § 2 av artikel X må beskattas i den avtalsslutande stat, i vilken fastigheten är belägen. b) Med förbehåll för vad som stadgas i punkt a) ovan skall gälla att förmögenhet, bestående av tillgångar som äro att hänföra till anläggnings- eller driftkapital i ett företags fasta driftställe, eller av tillgångar, som ingå i en stadig- varande anordning för utövandet av fritt yrke, må beskattas i den avtalsslutande stat i vilken det fasta driftstället eller den stadigvarande anordningen är belägen. c) Alla andra slag av förmögenhet, som innehavas av en person med hemvist i en av de avtalsslutande staterna, skola beskattas allenast i denna stat. Artikel XXIII § 1. I enlighet med vad som stadgas i grekisk lag angående kvittning mot grekisk skatt av skatt, som skall betalas i annat land, skall svensk skatt, som enligt svensk lag och i överensstämmelse med detta avtal direkt eller genom skatte- avdrag erlägges för inkomst från inkomstkällor i Sverige, kvittningsvis avräknas å varje grekisk skatt, som belöper å samma inkomst. § 2. Inkomst från inkomstkällor i Grekland, vilken inkomst i överensstämmelse med detta avtal må beskattas i Grekland antingen direkt eller genom skatteavdrag, skall vara undantagen från svensk skatt. Från denna regel skola dock följande undantag gälla: a) I sådana fall då inkomsten utgöres av 1) utdelning från ett bolag med hemvist i Grekland till en person med hemvist i Sverige och denne icke är ett sådant bolag, som i enlighet med vad som stadgas i § 3 av artikel VII är frikallat från svensk skatt, eller 2) ränta, å vilken § 2 av artikel VIII äger tillämpning och vilken utbetalas till en person med hemvist i Sverige, eller 3) royalty, å vilken § 2 av artikel IX äger tillämpning och vilken utbetalas till en person med hemvist i Sverige, skall svensk skatt beräknas på inkomstens bruttobelopp. Från den i enlighet härmed påförda svenska skatten skall avräknas den grekiska inkomstskatt, som belöper å samma inkomst. b) Vid tillämpningen av den under punkt a) ovan angivna undantagsbestämmelsen skall, då hel befrielse från eller nedsättning av den till utdelningen respektive räntan eller royaltyn hänförliga grekiska inkomstskatten meddelats för en bestämd tidsperiod, från den å ifrågavarande belopp påförda svenska skatten avräknas ett belopp motsvarande den grekiska inkomstskatt som skulle hava varit hänförlig till utdelningen, räntan eller royaltyn, därest sådan skattebefrielse eller skattenedsättning ej meddelats. c) sådana fall, då ränta uppbäres från inkomstkällor i Grekland av en person med hemvist i Sverige, skall - oberoende av bestämmelserna i punkterna a) och b) ovan - med avseende å de första tio beskattningsår, för vilka detta avtal äger tillämpning, från den å räntan belöpande svenska skatten av- räknas ett belopp motsvarande tio procent av räntans belopp. § 3. Om förmögenhet, som innehaves av en person med hemvist i Sverige, i enlighet med artikel XXII må beskattas i Grekland, skall förmögenheten i fråga vara undantagen från svensk skatt. § 4. Svensk progressiv skatt, som påföres personer med hemvist i Sverige, må beräknas efter den skattesats, som skulle hava varit tillämplig, om även sådan inkomst eller förmögenhet, som enligt föreliggande avtal är undantagen från beskattning, inräknats i den skattepliktiga inkomsten eller förmögenheten. Artikel XXIV § 1. Om enligt föreskrifterna i detta avtal en person med hemvist i Grekland är befriad från eller berättigad till nedsättning av svensk skatt, skall motsvarande befrielse eller nedsättning komma ett oskift dödsbo till godo, i den mån en eller flera av dödsbodelägarna äga hemvist i Grekland. § 2. Svensk skatt, som påföres ett oskift dödsbo, skall kvittningsvis avräknas i enlighet med bestämmelserna i artikel XXIII i den mån inkomsten tillkommer en dödsbodelägare med hemvist i Grekland. Artikel XXV § 1. Medborgare i en av de avtalsslutande staterna skola icke i den andra avtalsslutande staten bliva föremål för någon beskattning eller något därmed sammanhängande skattekrav, som är av annat slag eller mer tyngande än den beskattning och därmed sammanhängande skattekrav, som medborgarna i den senare staten under samma förhållanden äro eller kunna bliva under- kastade. § 2. Uttrycket \"medborgare\" betyder: a) Beträffande Grekland: Alla grekiska medborgare samt alla juridiska personer och andra sammanslutningar, som bildats jämlikt gällande grekisk lag. b) Beträffande Sverige: Alla svenska medborgare samt alla juridiska personer och andra sammanslutningar, som bildats jämlikt gällande svensk lag. § 3. Beskattningen av ett fast driftställe, som ett företag i en av de avtalsslutande staterna har i den andra avtalsslutande staten, skall i denna andra stat icke vara mindre fördelaktig än beskattningen av ett företag i den andra staten, som bedriver samma verksamhet. Vad nu sagts skall icke anses medföra förpliktelse för någon av de avtalsslutande staterna att medgiva personer med hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten personliga avdrag vid beskattningen, skattebefrielser och skattenedsättningar på grund av civilstånd eller försörjningsplikt mot familj, som medgivas personer med hemvist i den förstnämnda staten. § 4. Företag i den ena avtalsslutande staten, vilkas kapital helt eller delvis äges eller kontrolleras, direkt eller indirekt, av en eller flera personer med hemvist i den andra avtalsslutande staten, skola icke i den förstnämnda staten bliva föremål för någon beskattning eller något därmed sammanhängande skattekrav, som är av annat slag eller mer tyngande än den beskattning och därmed sammanhängande skatte- krav, som andra liknande företag i denna förstnämnda stat äro eller kunna bliva underkastade. § 5. I denna artikel avser uttrycket \"beskattning\" skatter av varje slag och beskaffenhet. Artikel XXVI Bestämmelserna i detta avtal påverka icke rätten att åtnjuta längre gående befrielser, vilka enligt folkrättens allmänna regler eller särskilda överenskommelser tillkomma diplomatiska eller konsulära befattningshavare. I den mån på grund av sådana längre gående befrielser inkomst och förmögenhet icke beskattas i den stat i vilken befattningshavaren är ackrediterad, förbehålles beskattningsrätten den utsändande staten. Artikel XXVII De behöriga myndigheterna i de avtalsslutande staterna må utbyta sådana upplysningar (av beskaffenhet att enligt de båda staternas respektive skattelagar stå till beskattnings- myndigheternas förfogande under deras sedvanliga tjänsteut- övning) som äro nödvändiga för att tillämpa bestämmelserna i föreliggande avtal eller för att förebygga bedrägeri eller för att tillämpa givna föreskrifter till förebyggande av skatteflykt i fråga om de skatter, som avses i avtalet. De utbytta upplysningarna skola behandlas såsom hemliga och få icke yppas för andra personer, befattningshavare vid domstolar inbegripna, än dem, som handlägga taxering och uppbörd av de skatter, som avses i avtalet, eller avgöra besvär i anslutning därtill. Sådana upplysningar få emellertid icke utbytas, som skulle röja affärshemlighet, hemlig tillverkningsmetod, yrkeshemlighet eller något i affärsverksamhet nyttjat förfaringssätt. Upplysningar som nu sagts må utbytas utan särskild begäran eller, i särskilda fall, efter därom gjord framställning. De behöriga myndigheterna i de avtalsslutande staterna skola överlägga med varandra i syfte att fastställa de upplysningar, som skola utbytas utan särskild begäran. Artikel XXVIII § 1. Kan skattskyldig visa att beskattningsmyndigheterna i de avtalsslutande staterna vidtagit åtgärder, som medfört eller komma att medföra en mot bestämmelserna i detta avtal stridande beskattning, äger han göra framställning i saken hos den behöriga myndigheten i den stat i vilken han äger hemvist. Sådan framställning skall göras innan besvär över beskattningen i fråga anförts hos grekisk skattedomstol. Befinnes framställningen grundad, skall den behöriga myndighet hos vilken framställningen sålunda gjorts vidtaga åtgärder för att träffa överenskommelse med den behöriga myndigheten i den andra avtalsslutande staten i syfte att undvika dylik beskattning. § 2. Skulle svårigheter eller tvivelsmål uppkomma rörande tolkningen eller tillämpningen av detta avtal, skola de behöriga myndigheterna i de avtalsslutande staterna avgöra frågan genom ömsesidig överenskommelse. Artikel XXIX Nedan angivna avtal mellan Grekland och Sverige skola icke tillämpas under tid, då föreliggande avtal är gällande, nämligen a) avtalet den 19 november 1931 om ömsesidigt fritagande från inkomstskatt i vissa fall av inkomster härrörande från rederi- rörelse; b) avtalet den 27 maj 1954 om ömsesidigt fritagande från be- skattning av inkomster härrörande från luftfartstrafik. Artikel XXX § 1. Detta avtal skall ratificeras av de avtalsslutande staterna i enlighet med vardera statens grundlagar och övriga föreskrifter. § 2. Ratifikationshandlingarna skola utväxlas i Stockholm snarast möjligt. § 3. Sedan ratifikationshandlingarna utväxlats skall avtalet äga tillämpning beträffande inkomst som förvärvats å eller efter den 1 januari det kalenderår, under vilket utväxling av ratifikationshandlingarna ägt rum, samt, såvitt avser den svenska statliga förmögenhetsskatten, i fråga om skatt som utgår på grund av taxering under eller efter kalenderåret närmast efter det, under vilket utväxling av ratifikations- handlingarna ägt rum. Artikel XXXI Detta avtal skall förbliva i kraft utan tidsbegränsning, men envar av de avtalsslutande staterna äger att - senast den 30 juni under ett kalenderår, dock icke tidigare än år 1965 - på diplomatisk väg skriftligen uppsäga avtalet hos den andra avtalsslutande staten. I händelse av sådan uppsägning skall avtalet upphöra att gälla beträffande inkomst som förvärvas å eller efter den 1 januari kalenderåret närmast efter det, varunder uppsägningen ägde rum, samt, såvitt avser förmögen- hetsskatt, i fråga om skatt som utgår på grund av taxering under eller efter det andra kalenderåret efter det, varunder uppsägningen ägde rum. Till bekräftelse härå hava undertecknade, därtill vederbör- ligen bemyndigade, undertecknat detta avtal och försett detsamma med sina sigill.
