# Privacy & Client Confidentiality

**CRITICAL READING FOR LEGAL PROFESSIONALS**

This document addresses privacy and confidentiality considerations when using this Tool, with particular attention to professional obligations under Swedish Bar Association (Advokatsamfundet) rules.

---

## Executive Summary for Legal Professionals

⚠️ **Key Risks:**
- Queries flow through Claude API infrastructure (Anthropic cloud)
- Query content may reveal client matters and privileged information
- Swedish Bar Association rules require strict data processing controls

✅ **Safe Use Options:**
1. **General Legal Research**: Use Tool for non-client-specific queries
2. **On-Premise Deployment**: Self-host with local LLM for privileged matters (see below)
3. **Anonymization**: Remove all client-identifying information from queries

---

## Data Flows and Infrastructure

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Architecture

This Tool uses the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to communicate with Claude:

```
User Query → MCP Client (Claude Desktop/API) → Anthropic Cloud → MCP Server (This Tool) → Database
```

**What This Means:**

1. **Queries Transit Anthropic Infrastructure**: Your queries are sent to Anthropic's servers for LLM processing
2. **Query Logging**: Anthropic may log queries subject to their [Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy)
3. **Tool Responses**: Database responses return through the same path
4. **No Direct Control**: You do not control Anthropic's data processing, retention, or security practices

### What Gets Transmitted

When you use this Tool through Claude Desktop or API:

- **Query Text**: The full text of your search queries
- **Tool Parameters**: Document IDs, provision references, filters, date ranges
- **Tool Responses**: Statute text, case summaries, preparatory works
- **Metadata**: Timestamps, user agent, API keys (handled by Anthropic)

**What Does NOT Get Transmitted:**
- Direct database access (Tool runs locally, queries Anthropic only for LLM processing)
- Files on your computer
- Your full conversation history (unless using Claude.ai web interface)

## Legal Professional Obligations

### Advokatsamfundet (Swedish Bar Association) Rules

Swedish lawyers are bound by **strict confidentiality rules** under the Advocates Act (Rättegångsbalken 8:4) and Advokatsamfundet's Code of Conduct.

#### Tystnadsplikt (Duty of Confidentiality)

**Applies to:**
- All client communications
- Client identity (in sensitive matters)
- Case strategy and legal analysis
- Information that could identify client or matter

**Consequences of Breach:**
- Professional disciplinary action
- Suspension or disbarment
- Civil liability to client
- Criminal liability (in extreme cases)

### GDPR and Client Data Processing

Under **GDPR Article 28**, when you use a service that processes client data:

- You are the **Data Controller**
- Anthropic is a **Data Processor**
- A **Data Processing Agreement (DPA)** may be required
- You must ensure adequate technical and organizational measures

**Do You Have a DPA with Anthropic?**
- Check [Anthropic's Commercial Terms](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms) for DPA coverage
- Confirm whether Anthropic's terms meet your GDPR obligations
- Consider whether client consent is required for third-party processing

---

## Risk Assessment by Use Case

### ✅ **LOW RISK**: General Legal Research

**Safe to use through Claude API:**

```
Example Query: "What does Swedish GDPR implementation say about data breach notification?"
```

- No client identity
- No case-specific facts
- No privileged strategy
- Publicly available legal information

### ⚠️ **MEDIUM RISK**: Anonymized Client Matters

**Use with caution:**

```
Example Query: "What are the penalties under Swedish criminal law for insider trading?"
```

**Risks:**
- Query pattern may reveal you're working on insider trading matter
- If you're the only lawyer in town handling securities cases, context may identify client
- Anthropic logs may link query to your API key → your practice → your clients

**Mitigation:**
- Remove ALL identifying details
- Use general terms, not case-specific facts
- Consider whether even legal area is sensitive (e.g., money laundering, terrorism)

### 🚫 **HIGH RISK**: Client-Specific Queries

**DO NOT USE through Claude API:**

```
Bad Example: "Find precedents for custody disputes involving allegations of substance abuse in Gothenburg"
```

**Why This is Dangerous:**
- Geographic specificity
- Case-specific facts
- May reveal client identity or confidential strategy
- May violate Advokatsamfundet rules even if client name not mentioned

**What to do instead:**
- Use Karnov, Juno, or other commercial legal databases with DPAs
- Use on-premise deployment (see below)
- Conduct manual research through official channels

---

## On-Premise Deployment

For **privileged legal matters**, deploy this Tool with a **self-hosted LLM** to eliminate external data transmission.

### Architecture

```
User Query → Local MCP Client → Local LLM (no external API) → MCP Server (This Tool) → Local Database
```

**Benefits:**
- No query data sent to Anthropic or any external service
- Full control over logging and data retention
- Compliant with Advokatsamfundet confidentiality rules
- GDPR-compliant (no third-party processors)

### Self-Hosted LLM Options

| Solution | Complexity | Model Quality | Cost |
|----------|------------|---------------|------|
| **Ollama** (local) | Low | Medium (Llama 3.1) | Free (hardware only) |
| **LM Studio** (local) | Low | Medium-High | Free (hardware only) |
| **OpenLLM** (local/cloud) | Medium | High (custom models) | Variable |
| **vLLM** (self-hosted cloud) | High | High (latest models) | Server costs |

### Hardware Requirements

For acceptable performance with a 70B parameter model (Llama 3.1 70B or similar):

- **GPU**: NVIDIA A100 (80GB) or H100 (recommended)
- **RAM**: 128GB+ system RAM
- **Storage**: 200GB+ SSD for models and database
- **Fallback**: Use smaller models (7B-13B) on consumer GPU (RTX 4090)

### Setup Guide

1. **Install Ollama** (easiest option):
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

   # Pull a model
   ollama pull llama3.1:70b
   ```

2. **Configure MCP to use Ollama**:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "swedish-law": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@ansvar/swedish-law-mcp"],
         "env": {
           "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "local",
           "LOCAL_LLM": "ollama",
           "LOCAL_LLM_MODEL": "llama3.1:70b"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Deploy Database Locally**:
   - Database is already local (SQLite file)
   - Ensure `data/database.db` is on encrypted disk
   - Run updates locally (`npm run sync:cases`, `npm run check-updates`)

### Cloud Deployment (Private VPC)

For law firms requiring cloud scalability with confidentiality:

1. **Deploy to Private AWS VPC or Azure VNet**
2. **Use Private Link/Private Endpoint** for all services
3. **Self-hosted LLM** on EC2/VM (no external LLM APIs)
4. **Encrypted Database** with KMS-managed keys
5. **Network Isolation** — no internet access, internal-only endpoints
6. **Audit Logging** — CloudTrail/Azure Monitor for compliance

**Estimated Cost**: €500-2000/month depending on usage and instance sizes

## Client Consent and Disclosure

### Do You Need Client Consent?

Under GDPR and professional ethics rules, consider whether you need **informed client consent** before using AI tools:

**Factors Requiring Consent:**
- Client data is transmitted to third-party processor (Anthropic)
- AI tool use may affect legal strategy or case outcome
- Client has reasonable expectation of confidentiality
- Professional rules require disclosure of AI use

**Recommended Practice:**
- Update engagement letters to disclose AI tool use
- Provide clients with information about data processing
- Offer opt-out for clients who object to AI use
- Document client consent in file

### Professional Disclosure

Some jurisdictions require disclosing AI tool use in legal work:

- **To Courts**: If AI-generated research cited in filings (always verify first!)
- **To Clients**: Best practice even if not strictly required
- **To Opposing Counsel**: Generally not required unless court rules mandate

**Sweden**: No specific disclosure requirement yet, but professional ethics (god advokatsed) may require transparency with clients.

## Security Best Practices

### Minimum Security Measures

1. **API Key Protection**: Store Anthropic API keys in secure vault, never in code
2. **Encrypted Storage**: Database file on encrypted disk (FileVault, BitLocker, LUKS)
3. **Access Control**: Limit database file permissions to your user account only
4. **Network Security**: Use VPN or private network if accessing remote MCP server
5. **Audit Trail**: Log when and how Tool is used for client matters

### Red Flags — Stop Using Immediately If:

- ❌ API keys committed to Git or shared in Slack
- ❌ Database file accessible to other users on shared computer
- ❌ Queries include client names, case numbers, or identifying information
- ❌ No Data Processing Agreement with Anthropic for client data
- ❌ Using personal Claude.ai account (web interface) for client work
